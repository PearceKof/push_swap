# Push_swap

## Description

The **Push_swap** project consists of sorting a list of integers using two stacks. The goal is to sort the numbers in ascending order on stack `a`, minimizing the number of operations performed.

## Rules

- You have 2 stacks named `a` and `b`.
- At the beginning:
  - Stack `a` contains a random number of negative and/or positive integers without duplicates.
  - Stack `b` is empty.
  
## Available Operations

- `sa`: Swap the first two elements of stack `a`.
- `sb`: Swap the first two elements of stack `b`.
- `ss`: `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
- `pa`: Push the first element of `b` onto `a`.
- `pb`: Push the first element of `a` onto `b`.
- `ra`: Rotate stack `a` upwards.
- `rb`: Rotate stack `b` upwards.
- `rr`: `ra` and `rb` at the same time.
- `rra`: Rotate stack `a` downwards.
- `rrb`: Rotate stack `b` downwards.
- `rrr`: `rra` and `rrb` at the same time.

## Instructions

1. **Compiler:** Use a Makefile that compiles the source files.
2. **Input:** The command `./push_swap` takes a list of integers as an argument.
3. **Output:** Displays the smallest list of instructions to sort stack `a`, separated by new lines.
4. **Error Handling:** If an error occurs, display "Error" on the standard error output.
5. **Validation:** A binary will be provided to verify your program.

## Usage Examples

$ ./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
sa
pb
pb
pb
sa
pa
pa
pa

$ ./push_swap 0 one 2 3
Error

## Benchmarks

For minimal validation, you must be able to sort 100 random numbers in fewer than 700 operations. For maximal validation, you must sort 500 numbers in no more than 5500 operations.

## Bonus

Create a `checker` program that verifies whether the instructions generated by `push_swap` properly sort the stack.
